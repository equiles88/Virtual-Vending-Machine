## Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software

You're developing an application for the newest vending machine distributor,
Umbrella Corp. They've released a new vending machine, Vendo-Matic 800, that's integrated
with everyone's bank accounts, allowing customers to purchase products from their computers for their convenience.

### Application requirements

- [X] The vending machine dispenses beverages, candy, munchies, and gum.
- [X] A main menu must display when the software runs, presenting the following options:
    > ```
    > (1) Display Vending Machine Items
    > (2) Purchase
    > (3) Exit
    > ```
- [X] The vending machine reads its inventory from an input file when the vending machine
starts. 
- [X] The vending machine is automatically restocked each time the application runs.
- [X] When the customer selects "(1) Display Vending Machine Items", they're presented
with a list of all items in the vending machine with its quantity remaining:
    - [X] Each vending machine product has a slot identifier and a purchase price.
    - [X] Each slot in the vending machine has enough room for 5 of that product.
    - [X] Every product is initially stocked to the maximum amount.
    - [X] A product that has run out must indicate that it's SOLD OUT.
- [X] When the customer selects "(2) Purchase", they start with a current money provided of 0.00.
They're guided through the purchasing process menu:
    ```
    Current Money Provided: $2.00
    
    (1) Feed Money
    (2) Select Product
    (3) Finish Transaction
    
    ```
- The purchase process flow is as follows:
    - [X] Selecting "(1) Feed Money" allows the customer to repeatedly feed money into the
    machine in whole dollar amounts.
        - [X] The "Current Money Provided" indicates how much money the customer
        has fed into the machine.
    - [X] Selecting "(2) Select Product" allows the customer to select a product to
    purchase.
        - [X] Show the list of products available and allow the customer to enter
        a code to select an item.
        - [X] If the product code doesn't exist, the vending machine informs the customer and returns them
        to the Purchase menu.
        - [X] If a product is currently sold out, the vending machine informs the customer and returns them to the
        Purchase menu.
        - [X] If a customer selects a valid product, it's dispensed to the customer.
        - [X] Dispensing an item prints the item name, cost, and the money
        remaining. Dispensing also returns a message:
          - [X] All Munchy items print "Crunch Crunch, Yum!"
          - [X] All Candy items print "Yummy Yummy, So Sweet!"
          - [X] All Drink items print "Glug Glug, Yum!"
          - [X] All Gum items print "Chew Chew, Yum!"
        - [X] After the machine dispenses the product, the machine must update the customer's balance
        accordingly and return the customer to the Purchase menu.
        - [X] To celebrate August, this machine is running a BOGODO sale, buy one
        item, get one dollar off any second item.
            - [X] After an item is purchased with the discount the discount resets. For example, if a third item is purchased a discount IS NOT applied. If a fourth item is purchased the discount DOES apply, and so on.
    - [X] Selecting "(3) Finish Transaction" allows the customer to complete the
    transaction and receive any remaining change.
        - [X] The machine returns the customer's money using nickels, dimes, and quarters
        (using the smallest amount of coins possible).
        - [X] The machine's current balance updates to $0 remaining.
    - [X] After completing their purchase, the user returns to the "Main" menu to
    continue using the vending machine.
- [X] The vending machine logs all transactions to prevent theft from the vending machine.
   - [X] Each purchase must generate a line in a file called `Log.txt`.
   - [X] The lines must follow the format shown in the following example.
       - [X] The first dollar amount is the amount deposited, spent, or given as change.
       - [X] The second dollar amount is the new balance.
        ```
        01/01/2019 12:00:00 PM FEED MONEY: $5.00 $5.00 
        01/01/2019 12:00:15 PM FEED MONEY: $5.00 $10.00 
        01/01/2019 12:00:20 PM Crunchie B4 $1.75 $8.25 
        01/01/2019 12:01:25 PM Cowtales B2 $1.50 $6.75 
        01/01/2019 12:01:35 PM GIVE CHANGE: $6.75 $0.00
        ```
- Create as many of your classes as possible to be "testable" classes. Limit console
input and output to as few classes as possible.
- Optional - Sales Report 
  - [ ] Provide a "Hidden" menu option on the main menu ("4") that writes to a sales
      report that shows the total sales since the machine started. The name of the
      file must include the date and time so each sales report is uniquely named.
      - [ ] An example of the output format appears at the end of this file.
- [ ] Provide unit tests demonstrating that your code works correctly.

### Vending machine data file
The input file that stocks the vending machine products is a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Each line is a separate product in the file and follows this format:

| Column Name   | Description |
----------------|-------------|
| Slot Location | The slot location in the vending machine containing the product.   |
| Product Name  | The display name of the vending machine product.                   |
| Price         | The purchase price for the product.                                |
| Type          | The product type for this row.                                     |

For example:
```
A1,U-Chews,1.65,Gum
A2,Ginger Ayle,1.85,Drink
A3,Snykkers,4.25,Candy
A4,Chippos,3.85,Munchy
```

**An input file is in your repository: `main.csv`.**
An alternate input file, `alternate.csv` is provided for testing purposes.
#### Challenge
To harden your program against errors, a third file, `problem.csv`, is provided. This file has a number of errors in it. Make sure it does not cause your program to crash. This will require changes to the file reading processing.

### Sales report
The output sales report file is pipe-delimited for consistency. Each line is a separate product with the number of sales for the applicable product. At the end of the report is a blank line followed by the **TOTAL SALES** dollar amount indicating the gross sales from the vending machine.

Items purchased at a discount through the BOGODO sale are the last number in the row for each item in the following format:

Taste Elevator Sales Report
item|amount sold full price|amount sold with BOGODO discount

For example:
>```
>Potato Crisps|0|0
>Stackers|1|0
>Grain Waves|0|0
>Cloud Popcorn|0|0
>Moonpie|3|1
>Cowtales|0|0
>Wonka Bar|0|0
>Crunchie|0|0
>Cola|2|1
>Dr. Salt|0|0
>Mountain Melter|0|0
>Heavy|0|0
>U-Chews|0|0
>Little League Chew|1|0
>Chiclets|1|0
>Triplemint|0|0
>
>**TOTAL SALES** $31.05
>```
